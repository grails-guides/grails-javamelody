Add monitoring to the app with JavaMelody. First, add the required dependency.

[source,groovy]
.build.gradle
----
include::{sourceDir}/build.gradle[indent=0, tag=monitoringDependency]
----

Sometimes, when using a Grails plugin you want to upgrade a transitive dependency which the plugin
author has not yet upgraded. If you run the gradle task `dependencies`, you will see the next dependency graph.

[source,bash]
----
\--- org.grails.plugins:grails-melody-plugin:1.70.0
     +--- net.bull.javamelody:javamelody-core:1.70.0
     |    \--- org.jrobin:jrobin:1.5.9
     +--- com.lowagie:itext:2.1.7
     \--- org.jrobin:jrobin:1.5.9
----

You can upgrade to the latest version of Java Melody 1.71.0 easily:

[source,groovy]
.build.gradle
----
include::{sourceDir}/build.gradle[indent=0, tag=monitoringDependencyTransitive]
----


And ... that's it, with JavaMelody now added to our application, restart the app and then navigate to
`http://localhost:8080/monitoring` and you should see the following.

At this point go click around the app and then return to the JavaMelody home page and expand
details to see that it has caught your activity in the app. By default JavaMelody looks at your
URIs to resolve HTTP Requests. This means that `/book/1` and `/book/6` will be listed separately.

If you do not want to get separate statistics per book, but an aggregate of the book detail endpoint,
you can tell JavaMelody to report on requests in aggregate. In our `application.yml.` add the
following:

[source,yml]
.grails-app/conf/application.yml
----
include::{sourceDir}/grails-app/conf/application.yml[indent=0, tag=monitoringConfig]
----

Now once you have restarted the app so it picks up our config changes, do the same as last
time, navigate to a few different books then return to `http://localhost:8080/monitoring` and
expand the details to see the aggregate data across multiple requests.

From the home screen you can easily filter your application statistics over different periods
of time by selecting `Day`, `Week`, `Month`, `Year`, `All`, or define a `Customized` range in
which to view stats. Additionally if you want to get a copy of all JavaMelody metrics for
offline viewing click the PDF button to download a copy.

If you want the ability to enable and disable JavaMelody easily just add the following to
your `application.yml` to be able to easily toggle monitoring on and off.

[source,yml]
.grails-app/conf/application.yml
----
javamelody:
    disabled: true
----


Similarly to HTTP request, you can aggregate stats for SQL monitoring.
Add the following to your `application.yml`.

[source,yml]
.grails-app/conf/application.yml
----
javamelody:
    sql-transform-pattern: \d+
----

If you are using Spring Security Core and Java Melody plugins in the same app, you will need to configure the security access to the `/monitoring` endpoint.

[source,yml]
.grails-app/conf/application.yml
----
grails:
  plugin:
    springsecurity:
      controllerAnnotations:
        staticRules:
          -
            pattern: /monitoring
            access:
              - ROLE_ADMIN
----

Adding the previous configuration to `application.yml` means you will need to be authenticated with a user who has `ROLE_ADMIN`
access to access the `/monitoring`.
